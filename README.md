# Movies-Recommender

This repository hosts a Streamlit-based movie recommendation web application that uses TF-IDF vectorization for live recommendations, alongside experimental notebooks exploring both TF-IDF and Word2Vec approaches.

Project Overview

The core of this project is a content-based movie recommender that leverages:
TF-IDF Vectorization on movie tags (deployed in app.py) for real-time recommendations.
Word2Vec Embeddings (in Movie_Recommender.ipynb) to compare semantic representations of tags.
